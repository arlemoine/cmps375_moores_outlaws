1. **Install PlatformIO**:
    - PlatformIO is an open-source ecosystem for IoT development. It supports multiple platforms and frameworks.
    - You can install PlatformIO as an extension in Visual Studio Code or as a standalone CLI tool.
    - For Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for "PlatformIO IDE", and install it.
    - For CLI, follow the instructions on the [PlatformIO installation page](https://platformio.org/install).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**:
    - Open Visual Studio Code and use the `File > Open Folder` menu to open the project directory.
    - PlatformIO should automatically detect the `platformio.ini` file and configure the environment.
    - Make sure to you are in a platformio project environment or the platformio toolbar will not show up.

4. **Install Project Dependencies**:

    - You can manually install dependencies using the PlatformIO CLI:
      ```sh
      pio lib install
      ```

## Building and Uploading the code

1. **Build the Project**:
    - Press the build button in the PlatformIO toolbar in Visual Studio Code (checkmark in the top right).
    - Alternatively, use the PlatformIO build command to compile the project:
      ```sh
      pio run
      ```

2. **Upload the Firmware**:
    - Connect your development board to your computer.
    - Use the upload button in the PlatformIO toolbar in Visual Studio Code (dropdown menu next to checkmark in the top right).
    - Alternatively, use the PlatformIO upload command to flash the firmware to the board:
      ```sh
